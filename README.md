# SPUR-Employment-Data

This project is a visualization of a research project I did with Professor Vasant Dhar at NYU Stern. I was looking to define the "quality" of various occupations, to potentially determine whether that job would be affected by automation in the future. 

One of the aspects I looked at was volatility of change in employment numbers from 2005 - 2015. This Tableau Story looks at how volatility could be (or not be) used as an indicator for other measures of job quality, including interactive skills and degree of automation.
