# SPUR-Employment-Data

This project is a visualization of a research project I did with Professor Vasant Dhar at NYU Stern. I wanted to look into the
definition of "interactivity," or tasks concerned with thought, communication, and inter-social activity as defined by Michaels,
Rauch, and Redding in their paper "Task Specialization in U.S. Cities from 1880-2000."

After receiving a data set from Professor Dhar, I looked further into the following job characteristics I thought was most related
to interactivity: 

Deductive_Reasoning
Fluency_of_Ideas
Inductive_Reasoning
Oral_Expression


Mathematical_Reasoning
Oral_Comprehension

Written_Comprehension
Written_Expression
Analyzing_Data_or_Information
Communicating_with_Persons_Outside_Organization
Communicating_with_Supervisors_Peers_or_Subordinates
Establishing_and_Maintaining_Interpersonal_Relationships
Estimating_the_Quantifiable_Characteristics_of_Products_Events_or_Information
Interpreting_the_Meaning_of_Information_for_Others
Making_Decisions_and_Solving_Problems
Resolving_Conflicts_and_Negotiating_with_Others
Updating_and_Using_Relevant_Knowledge
Active_Learning
Active_Listening
Critical_Thinking
Judgment_and_Decision_Making
Negotiation
Social_Perceptiveness
Writing

I took these characteristics and looked into how they differed across many occupations.

Bottom 5 in volatility: Physical therapists, education administrators (elementary and secondary school), occupational therapists, police and sheriff's patrol officers, lawyers.
Top 5 in volatility: Models, segmental pavers, prosthodonists, cooks (private household), locomotive firers.
